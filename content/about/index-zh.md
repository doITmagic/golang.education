## About Me
Hi, I am Huabing Zhao, a service mesh practitioner and evangelist, a senior engineer at [Tencent Cloud](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/tcm), a former technical expert at [ZTE](https://www.zte.com.cn/), a former ONAP project leader at [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), and a former senior consultant at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/). I created an open source project [Aeraki Mesh](https://aeraki.net) (CNCF Sandbox project), which can manage any layer-7 traffic in Istio service mesh, including Dubbo, Thrift, Redis, and any private protocol.
